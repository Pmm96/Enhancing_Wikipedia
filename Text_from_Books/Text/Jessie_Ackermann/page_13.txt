PREFACE.

Happily, the day has passed when it was the fashion for authors to apologize for their printed works. If a book has no reason for being, no number of apologies can make it acceptable; if it has a right to existence, no apology for it is necessary. It is left to those who may glance through these pages to determine to which class this little volume belongs.

A word of explanation is, however, due to both reader and writer. Most of the papers comprised in this book appeared in the Ladies' Home Companion during the year 1895. All were penned under numerous difficulties of time and place, and with no attempt at literary finish. In short, they are simply a series of rambling notes culled from many chapters in a rambling life. Let the sensible reader take it for granted that the author would cheerfully agree with him in changing whatever he would alter, and in leaving out whatever he would omit.

No mention is made in these pages of the great island continent of Australia, where the author spent much time. To present anything approaching an adequate picture of this wonderful land a whole volume would be necessary. Such a work the author has now in course of leisurely preparation, and in due season hopes to submit it to the public eye.

Chicago, Ill., January, 1896.

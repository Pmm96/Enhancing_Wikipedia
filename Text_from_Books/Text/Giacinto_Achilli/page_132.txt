IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI. 129

not having obtained the political success he so much desired of the Pope's return, he has not judged it oppor- tune to say much for us. But here is something that will surprise you, if he has received our letter. When I asked the General, at least the first moment of the last, somewhat quickly, that he had established with cer- tainty what he absolutely contested before his departure, namely, he replied, that our letter. When I said to him that this was more unfavourable than useful to the cause of Portici, he replied to me, that he did not deny it; but that my presence here and my proceedings were known, and our friends, hindering what he could have done himself, I said to him that our proceedings were entirely justified by the falseness of the informations that had been transmitted from hence, — to cast throws light on our perfect morality; of Dr. Achilli, — to regather by his enemies themselves; we had been able to prove ourselves victims of religious perse- cution, which our Government has publicly declared should not be exercised here under our flag; — it is the French flag which is also at the entrance of the Palazzo Maidaloni Prefect, and the Roman Police, as well as the Tricolour, where is afloat at the gate of the Castle of St. Angelo; of French Chasseurs at the arc of the Doctor, of the troop of the 3rd that we had held, in our proceed- ings, all that reserve which could accuse us in that respect, and without doubt no one would had promised to observe, " Not the least in the world," said the General with great kindness, " but I tell you very frankly, that if you retire I can do more than if you remain." " Oh ! I that nothing can place me upon I may be able to do more than I say, if you leave me the field free. I would not use an expression that would wound you; but . . . you can embarrass me . . . Reflect upon it, my good services, you understand me."

INQUIRIES AT ROME—THE FRENCH BRETHREN. 63

proceed to state the points respecting which we wish for accurate information.

We find from M. de Tocqueville, that besides the charge alleged against Dr. Achilli, imputations are cast upon his character generally. He is said to be a man held in little estimation (peu consideré), and representations to this effect M. de Tocqueville states come to him from ———. We shall be glad to know what foundation there is for such statements, and from what quarter they are likely to have been communicated to the parties mentioned.

Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to suggest how important it is that everything should be ascertained immediately, and before the priests or any other parties shall have time to tamper with witnesses, or otherwise to circumvent us in obtaining the ends of justice.

I remain, &c.,

(Signed) EDWARD STEANE.

John F. Ferrabee, Esq., British Consul, Rome.

The same evening, the Deputation met at the house of M. Adolphe Monod, a large assemblage of French brethren, including besides those previously mentioned, the Rev. Messrs. Auriry, Meyer, and Vallette, of the Confession of Augsburg, and others; and, in particular, M. Frederic Cuvier, Conseiller d'Etat, and Ancien Chef de la Section des Cultes non Catholiques au Ministere des Cultes. From this last gentleman the British brethren derived much valuable information on some legal points of the question, which his former official position qualified him to give.

MY BIOGRAPHY AND MY PROTEST.

[The portion of this document which relates to Dr. Achilli's previous history appears at page 7. After bringing down his memoir to his residence in Rome in 1849, he goes on to say:]

No one has ever had occasion to complain of me, and I have a sure conviction that no one has any reason to impute to me any failure in my moral conduct. The ecclesiastical tribunal of the Vicar of Rome, which deals with that subject, having taken cognizance of me at the beginning of my actual imprisonment, has found nothing to lay against me under that head; by which fact I am sufficiently justified. With regard to my political life, it is known to all that I have never interfered in the affairs of any Government, because when the Government was not according to my wishes I changed my residence, and when it was conducted in accordance with my views, I remained to enjoy the protection of the laws for my liberty, and for my religious life.

From the time when I withdrew from the ministry which attached me to the Roman Church, I believed my-self bound to render account to none but to God. Can the military Government of France not think that under I have been deceived? Did the Inquisition consider that I was quiet in my house when, on the night of the 29th of July, I was arrested, in the name of the Prefect of the French Police, and the next morning conducted to the prisons of the Inquisition of St. Angelo. After some days, it was intimated to me that I was, for the jurisdiction of the tribunal of the Inquisition, under religious reasons.

I protest against the illegality of my arrest, because it was without cause, and under another name, not my own.

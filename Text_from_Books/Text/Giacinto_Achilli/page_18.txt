IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR ACHILLI. 14

our discussion, which was afterwards continued with the others in the College of the "Penitentiary." I shall have these opportunities every day, without seeking them (I will certainly lose none), to render testimony to my Lord, whom I have served, and will serve as long as I live.

I intend to undertake a religious newspaper, and have already found one or two other assistants, and a printer has accepted the work. I must now find the necessary money. Another thing needful is a hall in which to begin prayer-meetings. Last Sunday we were three; next Sunday we shall be six or seven; I hope these numbers will increase proportionally, and that we shall have a noble Church. I should wish to do all this, and other things besides, if your Committee would do some- thing towards that which we must not lose the time for without much delay, since we propose, I should say, the Lord gives us that which is just.

Political affairs move on. Yesterday there was a great festival to celebrate the opening of the Constituent Assembly. I have never seen so few joyous among the people as on this occasion. The Roman journals did not show themselves more joyful. Let God protect us, and make it, and frankly said, that the Romans desire no more Pope than no more Pope; from these good aspira- tions we may hope that God will go on in advancing our work shall not be in vain, but that we may all go back in nothing, but that, in the name of Jesus who is our salvation and all our hope, we shall progress even to our celestial country.

So be it!

I am yours in the Lord,

G. ACHILLI.

Sir Culling Eardley.

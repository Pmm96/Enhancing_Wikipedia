but the French authorities ? Now, it is impossible in good faith to admit the irresponsibility of the person who contents himself with washing his hands, even though he may say, " I am innocent of the blood of that just man."

" And does the responsibility stop with the agents ? No, it ascends logically to the Government which had promised at the Tribune that such scenes should never be witnessed." The writer then calls upon the General to claim from Paris " the liberation of Dr. Achilli ; " and adds, " will do you a great honour, General ; be it either on the part of en- lightened Christians, of all communities, and of all nations, or on the part of all men of right feeling, or on the part of all good Frenchmen, it cannot but be hailed with acclamations of applause."

In the meantime, the General had been as good as his word ; for on Thursday, Dec. 20, while M. Meyrueis was quitting Rome, the French Govern- ment had received, in Paris, a telegraphic despatch, vid Toulon, from that city. The General announced to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the Roman Government had, at length, determined to set Dr. Achilli at liberty, conducting him to the frontiers ; provided the British Government, and his friends in England, would engage that he should leave Italy.

SECOND MEMORIAL TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. 45

are made to rest, and from their very form preclude the possibility of that searching investigation which truth and justice demand—the witnesses being con- cealed, the examinations private, and the advantage of any advice, nay, the very privilege of self-defence, in legal form, being withheld from the accused person.

Your Memorialists cannot pretend to have known Dr. Achilli in all the various positions which he occupied previously to his conversion to the Protestant faith, nor can they affirm his blamelessness anterior to that change; but they are fully capable of appreciating any discrepancy between the charges brought against him and the known public facts of his history, accredited as they are to them by sufficient testimony.

Your Memorialists, therefore, direct attention to the fact, that Dr. Achilli was a Priest and a Dominican Friar, in the Minerva at Rome, and a Lector of the College, in the year 1823, and, therefore, if it be true that a young lady who retired to a Convent at Viterbo, and pre- viously to taking orders, he was attached to, and it be true that he followed her to that place in order to become a Dominican, it is at all events a truth of at least twenty-six years' standing, and of which the authorities took no notice until he became a Protestant.

Your Memorialists subsequently, on the most satisfactory evidence, that subsequent to this date Dr. Achilli held several very important offices in the Order of the Dominicans; that he held high office at the Minerva College; that he was appointed Regent of Studies and (to which your Memorialists would call particular attention) Visitor of the Convents of Ronciglione and Lombardi, by which appointment it was committed to him to visit, regulate, and adjudicate in all the Convents from Rome to Florence,—an office which would not have been committed to a suspected man.

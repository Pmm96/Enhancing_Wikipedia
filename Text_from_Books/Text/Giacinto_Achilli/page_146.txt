â€”lastly, my leaving Rome and going out of Italy had been a consequence of the foregoing antecedents; it did not signify whether I went to the English or Spanish dominions; I did not consider it my duty to render an account to any man upon questions of faith. But Monsignor, intending to enter at greater length upon my replies, turned the conversation that way; he diverted it by some new question. The second interrogatory closed with the air-terrace of the Castle, about a quarter of an hour on the little every day for a single hour to let me take the air a little every day. He ordered the gaoler to be perfectly satisfied with me, and that we were perfectly agreed!! I do not know with what truth he could say so, for his whole answers were nothing whatever but a refusal to my questions, and an anxious spirit for the Inquisition! Hate always been opposed to his. But truth itself points out his dissimulation, as my spirit showed itself throughout before our Lord. At taking leave this second time, both my Judges shook hands with me, saying, that they would return shortly. Eight days elapsed, when I was again asked for, and went down stairs laughing, when, in his place, I beheld a Priest of the Oratory alone, who was prisoner; and "Here is Banlisazzi!" cried my fellow-prisoner, laughing at the mistake. I perceived at once by his accent that he was not Italian. I inquired his name and the object of his coming. He replied, that he was come to pay me a visit, and showed me his name on the title-page of a book: "Ecclesiastical History of the Prussian Silesia, Professor of ... Dr. Augusti." Then, in the name of the Propaganda, in Rome, he said that he was grieved at my present situation, but that all would be for the best if I would only reconcile towards God, and towards the Holy Mother the Roman Catholic Church.

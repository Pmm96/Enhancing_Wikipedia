IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.

Peter," was received with much pleasure, and it much helped us at Easter, when all are accustomed to confess. I have not been able to print the other, the title of which is the "Chair of St. Peter" (that is, "the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, founded on the universal See of St. Peter"). Because my printer begged me to stop, fearing the speedy return of the Papal Government. However, if a Lord gives us peace again, I will continue my pub- lications. I received, some time ago, a letter from the Rev. David Pitcairn, of Torquay, who informs me that there prayer had been offered up for me by the members of the Evangelical Alliance. I should wish you to let that gentleman know how full of gratitude I feel for this true kindness, and I exhort him in our Lord Jesus Christ to continue to me this favour. Every day I am more and more indebted for what little I have hitherto been enabled to do.

Thank dear Mr. Herschell for his kindness in collect- ing the offerings of Christian brethren. May God, who desires the establishment of His kingdom in these lands, protect all His brethren who agree in it!

Salute with me all the Evangelical Alliance.

Yours most truly,

G. ACHILLI.

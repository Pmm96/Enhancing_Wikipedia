IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.

You see what progress the spirit of reform is making in Rome, and what good is to be expected in this country. All this is owing to the reading of the Bible. No day passes in which persons do not come to my house to ask for the New Testament, and to speak on religion. Lately, while the shells were falling in every part of the city, several persons used to meet in my house, to read the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to pray. Imagine what was my gratification, in seeing this work of the Spirit of the Lord! And if it pleases God, no doubt, Rome peaceably and numerous congregations will ask the Government for a liberty of worship. Then will the reign commence for a Church for our worship. At present, an article in favour of the new statute there was, to the religions of the State, in Catholicism, declaring it to be the first law of our us. I wrote against it, stating many reasons; and in our meeting we prayed the Lord to cancel it, and in its place to put another article, which guarantees religious liberty, both as to liberty of thought, and expression, and of association. Do you not see the grace and mercy of God in all these things? It appears to me as if many rays of light have shone from heaven! Whatever may be the reign of darkness alongside, I see also innumerable rays of light. I do not believe that Austria can again reign in this country. At all events, changes may wish to impose on us, even though they glorious. Our present question is destroying their earthly power temporal, and the spirit of the people is tolerably decided on this subject. One knows not what may happen, and the affairs will fall altogether from the priests to political. I say, we will not know to-day. With regard to to-morrow, France wishes to overthrow our Republic; but can she destroy our Republicans? She will restore the Papal Government; but can she extinguish the hatred

M. O. BARROT.—MALTA.—MEMORIAL TO LORD PALMERSTON. 41

General Oudinot. A Memorial was also sent from Malta to Lord Palmerston, on the 20th August, before there had been time for any suggestion from England, signed by the Chaplain to the Forces in the island, the Presbyterian Minister, the Agent of the Bible Society, the Treasurer of the Malta College, of which Dr. Achilli had been a Professor, Dr. de Sanctis,* till lately Curé of the largest parish in the city of Rome, and like Dr. Achilli a convert to the Protestant faith, and several other persons of weight. It stated that he had been some time a resident in Malta, and Professor at the College at St. Julian's there; that, having left Rome in 1842, and having from conviction renounced the doctrines of the Roman Church, he remained in the Ionian Islands and in Malta between the years 1842 and 1847, supporting himself by literary and theological pursuits; and

* Dr. de Sanctis has fully vindicated his brother and compatriot in the " Cattolico Cristiano," a journal published in Malta. While I lived in Viterbo, and we were also there, he was the oracle of the nunnery for more than the following brief extract:—" All I wish I had never often witnessed the confessors of the nuns in the nunnery of Viterbo, after each confession, returning to the parlour with their handkerchiefs full of gold and silver coins." (After proving that the whole story of the poisoning of a nun is a wicked invention, he adds): " It is false that he fled from Viterbo. He left Viterbo in 1842. He was then Professor of Theo- logy and Philosophy in the Episcopal Seminary, Canon Theologian, and the man most esteemed among the clergy of Viterbo."

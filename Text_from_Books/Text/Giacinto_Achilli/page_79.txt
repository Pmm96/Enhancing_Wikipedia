MESSRS. TONNA AND MEYREUIS DELAYED ON THE ROAD. 75

post to our friends who are going to Lyons, begging them to delay their departure for Rome till the arrival of the next post.

I have just received a letter of introduction from General d'Hautpoul, of which I enclose a copy; and General Oudinot promised us this morning to clear Achille's character by local inquiries; but our friends, if they went to Rome, might essentially miss us, to the French Embassy in Rome. It is essential to us to clear days perbaps, after all, the kindness of the French Government may render necessary.

Believe me, my Lord, with sincere obligation for your cordial help,

Your faithful and obedient servant,

C. E. EARDLEY.

To H. E. The Marquis of Normandy.

Lord Normandy was satisfied, on seeing the terms of General d'Hautpoul's introduction, that MM. Tonna and Meyreuis might safely proceed to Rome, and advice was accordingly sent to them to do so, which overtook them at Marseilles.

The following are the most important portions of the letter in which that opinion was communi- cated :â€”

Paris, Hotel Bristol, Nov. 9, 1849.

My dear Sir,

We think that positive orders were at once proceeded to Rome. We know at least that you had better gone to Rome for our friend's liberation, or that conditional orders had been sent to liberate him in the event of certain contingencies

IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI. 52

Noel, Mr. Cowan, Dr. Steane, and myself, accompanied by Dr. Grand Pierre and M. Adolphe Monod, had a long interview with M. de Tocqueville at the Foreign Office. We presented a "Memorial" to the Minister, with a document appended, entitled, "My Biography and Protest," drawn up by Dr. Achilli. This latter document, dated October 1st, his prison to England, and it reached London just in time to be picked up by Mr. Cowan on his way from Edinburgh to Paris, where it was delivered to the Deputation in time to be translated and made use of. This is one of many instances in which the proceedings of the Deputation have received remarkable Providential assistance. The two papers are subjoined. The "Biography and Protest," which accompanied the letter from Dr. Achilli, is also added, as having great interest for Dr. Achilli's friends, though it was not, of course, put before the Minister.

On the other hand, the removal of Dr. Achilli's transfer to the priests, or the removal of the French troops, before we reach Rome, we feel it to be our duty to submit, at your request, to the further delay. By going to Rome, we are morally certain that we could establish the satisfaction of your authorities with that foundation; and this must result in Dr. Achilli's liberation. You will, therefore, feel, Sir, that in delaying our journey, we give the Archilli an additional claim upon the French Government. We entrust him to the honour of France, in the confidence that you will not much longer, by your doing so, us, in the course of Monday, suffer that day informing us, your despatch from Rome, that, having delayed going at your request, we may be prepared for our departure for Rome after its arrival.

I have the honour to be, Sir,

Your obedient servant,

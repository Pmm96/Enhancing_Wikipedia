On the 13th November, the last member of the Deputation had returned to England.

The scene now changes from Paris to Rome, where, on November 20, MM. Tonini and Mey- rueis arrived, having on their way passed some days at each of which places prayer was offered for Dr. Achilli, and conversations were held on the intro- duction of religion and religious freedom into Italy.

PETITION OF ROMANS TO LORD PALMERSTON. 89

Rome were on the point of signing a petition to
Lord Palmerston, for English protection to evan-
gelical worship.

The same afternoon, they learnt from Mr. Hely,
and other members of the arrest, which will be
found detailed in M. Tonna's report of December 17.
They found that he was now well treated, and ascer-
tained the names of the Physician, and of the
Captain, of the Fortress.

They then called on Mr. Freeborn, who had
seen General Baraguay d'Hilliers, and had been
favourably impressed by him. "The General had
expressed to him his fears that 'ces Messieurs etaient
trop ardens,' and Mr. Freeborn again, at his desire,
cautioned them to be calm, discreet, &c.

Mr. Freeborn handed over the Report made by
Signor , after the investigation which he had,
at the instance of the Deputation to Paris, instituted
at Viterbo. Signor was also introduced,
and gave an emphatical assurance that the accusa-
tion about the nun was an utter and entire fabrica-
tion. The substance of that document will be found
hereafter embodied in Mr. Tonna's report. Two days
later, Mr. Freeborn, in the presence of our friends,
unsealed and opened Dr. Achilli's papers, which had
been placed in his custody after the arrest. They

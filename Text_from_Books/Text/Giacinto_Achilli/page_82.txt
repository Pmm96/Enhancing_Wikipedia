IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR ACHILLI.

We will now add a few observations on the object of your journey.

The French Government have just learned, for the first time, that Dr. Achilli's arrest in Rome was effected without any sanction by the French police in Rome.

It seems, therefore, important to ascertainâ€”

1st, The exact hour, as well as day, of his arrest.

2nd, The exact hour and day of Dr. Achilli's transfer to the prison of the Holy Office, and whether during the whole of the time the French police were, as we believe, the only legal police of the city.

3rd, The names of the persons who arrested him, and whether they are known agents of the Vicar of Rome.

4th, The exact words they used; that is to say, whether it can be proved that they arrested him in the name of the French Prefect of Police; whether they addressed him by his own, or by what name; and whether they showed or produced a warrant.

5th, What offence was imputed to him at first; and whether, since the interference of the French Government on his behalf, it has been attempted to change the ground of complaint, and substitute other accusations.

It will be useful to know all other particulars of his imprisonment, such as the officials before whom he has been successively taken, and the time and reason of his transfer from one place of confinement to another; was the transfer exclusively from the interference of friends, or in part at the instance of the Inquisition.

Next to Dr. Achilli's deliverance, we feel very anxious that his character should be cleared. We have scarcely alluded to the accusations of so cruel and murderous a tendency as those now made against him; and which we hope may be verified, and which we trust you will succeed in satisfying his friends that the whole is a mere pretext.

IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.

93

the fortress in which Dr. Achilli has been confined, cannot fail to be interesting to his friends :—

We first crossed a drawbridge spanning the first or outer ditch, which encircles the bastioned enceinte. We walked quite round this. On each of the four bastions a gun is mounted, bearing commands to the south and west a view of the Campagna), the Trastevere, and to the north and east of Rome. All dressed in military clothing, who were the prisoners, and of the look with much interest on entering the deep and damp ditch which separates the enceinte from the inner tower. The base of this latter is of ancient construction. We then crossed another drawbridge, which spans, in a straight line, the whole fourfold path which crosses this second ditch, and our sloping ourselves at the entrance of a long staircase or each of the tower. Ascended by steps and landings, in four places (as we were successively lighted and intercepted, which planks would afford duly) by positions of defence against a party forcing its way from without. On reach- ing the top, we turned to the left, and, arriving at an iron- grated door, by French soldiers who seemed the uncon- cerned manner in which the gate, and concluded that we had a pass, unlocked the gate, and admitted us to a plat- form or court, in which we walked up, among the upper buildings of the Castle, and amongst them our friend we had passed. Above this court again, rise the poli- tical prisoners are kept, in which, the more important pri- soners than the corporal were.

Further Told this word, and were informed that, if he were to see the Commandant, that not had come to the Castle to see him, we should find him below,—a fact which we knew very well.

* Let our friends mark—the soldiers inside the fortress are French.

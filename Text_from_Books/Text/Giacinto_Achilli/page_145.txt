FISCAL AND CHANCELLOR OF THE INQUISITION. 141

Inquisition, with special permission of the French authorities, had come to take possession of me. You can imagine the indignation felt, and the severe expressions employed against the priests and the French. I alone smiled in the midst of the universal excitement. Four days afterwards (still in 1842), why I had abandoned the interrogatory announced. Thereupon, a new and very long Order of Dominicans, in majestic robes of the Inquisition, received so many testimonies of esteem and good will, as even to be promoted, from youth, to the highest and most important posts with difficulty granted to the aged? Why I had afterwards abandoned the ministry of the Roman Church, my theological functions, the mass, and other religious duties, showing myself thankless and ungrateful for my education, and for the interest taken in me at home? What complaint I had to make of the Inquisition in 1842, the only object of which was to recall me to correction? Lastly, why I had left Rome and gone out of Italy to take refuge in Protestant countries, and the right path I subsequently chose?

If I calmly replied, with a few words to each question, to which of my best friends and to the fearful inquiry of my scandal? This is the substance of the second examination, to which I was subjected, and of the words I uttered.

—That motives of conscience had induced me to leave the Dominicans, to whom I still felt grateful for their kindness; —that motives of conscience had led Pope Gregory XVI., unacquainted with the Inquisition, and far from being displeased with the Roman Church, also tranquilly declared, to all the charges of the ministry, and thereby resigned it sufficiently for whoever chose to understand me, that thenceforward I did not intend to belong to that Church any longer or in any manner, but regarding myself, in matters of faith, bound to no one but to God.

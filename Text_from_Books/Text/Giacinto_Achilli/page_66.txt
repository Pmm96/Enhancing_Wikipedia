We take leave to add a request, which we address to your feelings of humanity, that you would give orders that the prisoner be allowed, not the retrenched fare of the Castle of St. Angelo, but provisions of the quality his health requires. Such a step would destroy our last hope, by taking him again from under the protection of the French authorities.

In any case, we will not go without informing you. And be good enough to procure us the means of seeing the unhappy prisoner, if that journey becomes necessary. You will be good enough to see that the charges, which have been made against him, form our chief object, in such a case, being on behalf of the Deputation of the Evangelical Alliance.

Your faithful and obliged servant,

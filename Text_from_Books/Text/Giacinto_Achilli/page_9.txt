THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE.

they accomplished the object themselves,—knowing that the case against the Roman Government was so strong, that it will have the wisdom not to protest against the abstraction of their prisoner. For this result, though tardily obtained, it would be ungenerous not to thank the President and Government of France. To General Baraguay d'Hilliers our thanks are also due. It might compromise him if I said more; but I should be wanting in a duty if I said less.

M. le Comte de Gasparin, the Parliamentary champion of Protestant liberties in the late Chamber of Deputies, Messrs. Frederic and Adolph Monod, with others of our brethren in Paris, have worked cordially with us,—but men engaged in a cause common to them all, need not one another's thanks. Duty, however, requires me to say, that but for the investigations and efforts, at Rome, of Messrs. Tonna and Meyrueis, our evidence would have been incomplete, and our efforts unsuccessful. To these friends, whose journey across Europe was the means of procuring that information which led to Dr. Achilli's deliver- ance.

In closing these prefatory remarks, I cannot but express my confidence that the untruthful imprisonment will open the eyes of thousands to Dr. Achilli's innocence and enable him with the blessing of God to do more good than ever in the face of Italy. Those who are not afraid to encounter the Papacy with the weapons which are "not carnal," especially by introducing into Italy those principles of Scripture truth, which are the best, because the Divine, antidotes to infidelity on the one hand, and to idolatry and tyranny on the other.

I beg you to believe me,

Your faithful and attached friend,

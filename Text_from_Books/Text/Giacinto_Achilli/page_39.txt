CONFIDENCE IN GOD—DR. ACHILLI'S ARREST. 35

occurred—to which the following communication
relates :—

Rome, August 2, 1849.

Sir,—A gentleman well known to you by name, Dr. G.
Achilli, member of the Evangelical Alliance in London,
was arrested at eleven o'clock, a.m., on the 29th ult., by
three men dressed in plain clothes, and not presenting any
paper of authorisation, but who intimated that they came
by order of the French Prefect. All this was false; for
this arbitrary act, I have subsequently discovered, has
been a manoeuvre of the Pope's Vicar, and his associates.
I have learned, also, that the unfortunate man is already
thrown into a secret dungeon of the so denominated
" Holy Office"—perhaps doomed to the horrible tortures
and wretched end often inflicted in that abominable and
fiendish establishment!

Mr. Freeborn, British Consular Agent here (who in
many instances has acted, in the late unhappy circumstances,
with a most laudable spirit of humanity towards those
who have needed his assistance or protection), has taken
up, most feelingly, this momentous case also; but he is
not solely supported. I fear much for his success in saving
the virtuous Dr. Achilli, whose only fault has been that of
having too firmly trusted in the justice of the cause he has
embraced. He had been carried with the spirit of light,
and he generously and righteously wished to share that
light with his fellow-creatures, and especially with his
oppressed countrymen.

I pray, Sir, do not lose a moment in communicating
this melancholy occurrence to the members of the Evan-
gelical Alliance, and in interesting all those who at all can
promote our Christian friend's liberation.

Sir C. E. EARDLEY, Bart.

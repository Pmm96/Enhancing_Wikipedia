LETTER TO MR. TONNA.—AVOID PROPAGANDISM. 79

We strongly advise your abstaining from anything that might be interpreted as "Protestant Propaganda" in Rome. It is important that, on all occasions, that you should have no such plea against you.

It will be well to say, that the Papal authorities are cognizant of your intended journey to Rome; that you know that M. M'Crie has his personal friend Dr. Achilli, and come as an attached acquaintance of Dr. Achilli and his friends; and that, though the Deputation of the Evangelical Alliance, appointed at Glasgow, has thankfully welcomed your journey, you are not, properly speaking, part of that Deputation. We have abstained from going to Rome on purpose to avoid any complaint that the Papal Government might make against such a mission of Protestant Society. And we, therefore, leave the subject in your hands. If, however, this appear on record, to be referred to, Believe me, my dear sir,

Faithfully yours,

C. E. EARDLEY.

L. H. J. Tonna, Esq., Marseilles.

P.S.—Information which has reached us leads us to believe that, by documents, that Dr. Achilli has received able to prove the greatest importance attaches to your being ecclesiastical, and that they took the first opportunity of his since the time of his imputed crime. It is asserted that it is not so, and honours, especially within the Roman States, return to the Roman States to arrest him.

I am sure I need not impress on you the importance of so acting in the matter, that if the accusation of his enemies should be verified (which I will not anticipate), nothing should have been done which might be regretted, or which would compromise the cause of the common faith.

The papers this morning announce that General Baraguay d'Hilliers is gone to Rome, not only as General,

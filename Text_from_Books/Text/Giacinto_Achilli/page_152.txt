faith was the motive principleâ€”that faith which justifies us before God, unto whom alone be glory and honour and blessing, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

I am, my Dear Sir,

Yours affectionately,

GIACINTO ACHILLI.

Will not every Christian say Amen to our brother's giving of thanks?

I will add no more, as Dr. Achilli will speedily be in England to answer for himself. In closing, I will only express the hope, first, that in speaking as I have done of the Court of Rome, I shall be understood as not for an instant believing that Roman Catholics in general have a fellow-feeling with its tyranny; and, secondly, that in avoiding, as far as consistent with my object, the publication of the acts and words of public men, my motives will be appreciated.

This work I commit in faith to God, in the name of my Lord and Saviour, who can, if he think fit, employ even such a simple narrative as the present for the promotion of His gracious purposes.

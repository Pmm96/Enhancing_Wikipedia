IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.

they now hold the priests renders them disposed to admit things they may have been deceived by them in many things. For which reason it is now easy to reach their minds, and contradict the doctrines invented by the priests. Nevertheless, it is necessary to do so with some caution; and it is a good rule to begin some religious discourse with a reference to State matters. This is the plan we pursue. I have contented myself, till now, with speaking privately in the way of personal appeal; but I shall soon take the opportunity of speaking also in public to the people. I am waiting for the passing of the statute in which there will be the very important article of religious liberty. I have communicated my ideas, and they are to the Deputies of the Assembly, who are my friends, to whom I am occupied myself for this object with some of my hand, and shall say that when the law is established, I shall present myself to the public with the Bible in the one hand and with reason in the other.

Then, how grateful I am to those good brethren who publishing newspapers will most opportune, and also the tracts whatsoever ye shall have in poster. Therefore, "All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them." Thus Christ, "for the Lord is with us." I feel full of strength in consequence of the certain faith which the Lord gives me. Forward! for the kindest salutations to our friends. Pray often for us. May the Lord be with us!

Adieu! Your brother,

G. ACHILLI.

Have I told you that we meet twice a-week, Thursdays and Sundays, in the evenings, to read and meditate upon the Scriptures, and to pray?

INTERIOR OF THE CASTLE.—M. A. DE DOMINIS. 93

Again the ponderous grating was unlocked, and we retraced our steps down the long and gloomy staircase; and, finding that the Commandant had not arrived, we left the fortress with a depression of spirit which we could not shake off for the rest of the day.*

In many parts of the Castle we saw inscribed on the walls the name of ALEXANDER VI., the infamous Borgia, and particularly an immense inscription over the gateway of the tower—

ALEXANDER VI. PONT. MAX.
RESTAVRAVIT ANNO SAL. 1495.

In walking round the ramparts we repeatedly stopped in places where we could see the grated and boxed-up windows of the prisoners, in the hope that perhaps our friend might be looking from some crevice, and be com- forted by seeing us.

* Well might our friend be depressed, if he thought of all the gloomy associations connected with the Castle of St. Angelo. One especially recurs to the memory with peculiar force. It is that of Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson's "Italy" (p. 144, &c.), to which his "Discovery of the Theory of the Prismatic Colours" at Venice, states that Marc Antonio de Dominis published, in 1611, a work entitled "De Radiis Visus et Lucis in Vitris Perspectivis et Iride Tractatus." He became Professor of Mathematics at Padua, and Bishop of Segni, his see, and wrote a book in favour of the Vene- tians. He went to Heidelberg, in Germany, where he became a Protestant. At the instance of Sir H. Wotton, Ambassador of James I., he returned to England, and was made Dean of Windsor. He afterwards recanted, and returned to the Roman communion. On the death of Paul V., who was his protector, he was imprisoned in the Castle of St. Angelo, where his life was cut short (1625), as it is supposed, by poison; and his body and writings were burned together in the Campo di Fiori, in the city of Rome.

The idea of the vacuum is a very important one in physics. In the seventeenth century, it was thought that the vacuum was impossible. This was because it was believed that there was a force called "horror vacui" (horror of the vacuum) that prevented the formation of a vacuum. However, in the eighteenth century, it was shown that the vacuum is possible. This was done by Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer. The barometer is a device that measures the pressure of the atmosphere. Torricelli showed that the pressure of the atmosphere is not constant, but varies with altitude. This means that there must be a point at which the pressure of the atmosphere is zero. This point is called the vacuum.

The vacuum is a very important concept in physics because it is the state of lowest energy. This means that all other states of matter are unstable and will eventually decay into the vacuum. The vacuum is also very important in cosmology because it is thought that the universe began in a state of vacuum.

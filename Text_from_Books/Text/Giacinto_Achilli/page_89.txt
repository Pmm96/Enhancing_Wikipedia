DEFENCE OF THE CARDINALS—CERTIFICATE OF ARREST. 53

mation which they had received as to the mode of arrest, of which the following certificate was placed in the hands of the General on November 27, 1849:—

Rome, Nov. 13, 1849.

We hereby solemnly declare that we were living with Dr. Achilli in Rome, at the Palazzo Borghese, when, on the 29th July, 1849, at eleven o'clock of the night, hav- ing heard some one knock, we opened the door, and saw three police agents of the French Prefecture. They inquired for a person of the name of Domenico Antonio Achilli. We answered that a gentleman lived there whose name was Achilli; but that he was from Viterbo, and not Domenico Antonio; and accordingly we did not admit them to pass. They became exceedingly insolent, and threatened to place two guards to watch him, if he did not avow his name to be that which they asserted. Dr. Achilli then replied, that the question being as it appeared, merely concerning the identity of his name, he had no difficulty whatever in going with them to the French Prefect of Police (as they had already signified to him); but he simply intended to go to rectify the apparent mistake, but did not return again; so he went off with them, respecting his real name. We hereby also declare, that the agents of the police did not produce any warrant, or written order from the legal authorities, for Dr. Achilli's arrest. The whole of what we have above stated passed in our presence, and we are ready to affirm it also by oath.

FRENCH CO-OPERATION IN ARREST SUGGESTED. 107

and Sergeant-major Desant (not de Saint). M.
Gandon being at the theatre, M. de Meyrueis was
unable to find him that night.

The next day, M. Meyrueis went to the street
where the Voltigeurs, or light company, of the 25th
Light Infantry are quartered, and there he found
Sergeant-major Desant. He explained to him
the object of his visit, but he replied that he had no
recollection of such an occurrence on the 29th July.
Adjutant Gandon being then engaged with the whole
of the officers and non-commissioned officers, our
friend did not wish to speak to him before them, and
therefore begged him to fix a time to see him, which
he did. At the hour appointed, the Adjutant met him.
He told him that on the spot, he had been arrested
under such and such circumstances, and that, having
heard he had been a friend of his, begged him to
tell him " all the particulars." " Your company," he
added, " was quartered in the Palazzo Borghese,
and you were supping in the porter's lodge with
Sergeant-major Desant."

" No," he said, " not Desant ; the circum-
stance very well. It was a young man who was
arrested while in bed with his wife. He is married,
is he not ? "

" He is."

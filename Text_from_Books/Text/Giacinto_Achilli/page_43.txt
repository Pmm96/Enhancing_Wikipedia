BRITISH MEMORIAL TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. 39

propriety of his occupation, one of the first acts of the restored Papal power, in the person of the governing Cardinals, has been to seize on the person of Dr. Achilli, and to confine him in the secret dungeons of the Inquisition.

That, on the night of the 29th of July, three persons entered the house in which Dr. Achilli dwelt, under the false pretence that they acted under the authority of the French Prefect, and arrested him, and threw him into prison, and that his personal friends have since had no communication with him.

That the Committee, who feel themselves responsible for the safety of Dr. Achilli, wish in no way to shield him by their interference, if it can be proved that he has infringed any law; but they believe, on the contrary, that his actions have been strictly legal, they do earnestly entreat the prompt, friendly, and powerful interference of the French Government on behalf of the injured Dr. Achilli, to establish a search- ing investigation; and that, if he is not charged with any legal offence, he may be liberated forthwith, and that if he is so charged, he may be imprisoned under the manifest protection of legal authority, and be brought to a fair and open trial.

The Committee desire to confide in the case of a really unof- fending and injured man to the honour, liberality, and humanity of the French Government, a France, who will not, they feel confident, sanction a violation of the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty in Rome, at a time when the flag of France still floated on the Capitol, and under the assumed sanction of the name that they will at once readily be alive to the pressure, and meet the exi- gencies, of the case.

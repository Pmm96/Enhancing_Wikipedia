LETTER TO MR. TONNA—TO BROCKEN—COUNSEL. 77

is felt to your journey provided you use the utmost circumspection.

Lord Normandy, also, in a letter dated the 7th, says, that he "sees no objection to those gentlemen undertaking the journey to Rome, provided they conform to the request of their predecessors, when they present applications to create greater difficulties than at present appear to exist."

Our advice to you, therefore, is, to go as rapidly as you can to Rome, and to present when there as him yesterday the enclosed letter from General d'Hautpoul, Minister of War; and the other two letters, which General Oudinot has been good enough to give, for Secretary M. Feryreus, and M. de la Tour d'Auvergne, Secretary of Embassy, to Colonel Rivarol. Attached to the Embassy, you act under his immediate orders. It will be wise to put yourselves very much into the hands of the Ambassador, to receive his advice, and especially to abstain as much as possible from all needless conversation or proceedings which might make the object of your journey notorious in Rome. If two, three, or four persons necessarily know the fact, they should be engaged not to mention it. It may not be amiss that, by whomsoever you take this course, it should not be made the subject of conversation in Rome, it is very advisable that you also, your object in Rome should not be made the subject of conversation.

We advise your asking Dr. Achilli himself at once specific accusations against Liberty, to you will see the best about requesting permission to visit him. If you can do so without attracting much attention, it seems to us that it may be as well, for in the case of the Pontifical jealousy being aroused, and of your being suddenly sent out of Rome, you would regret not having received explanations from his own lips.

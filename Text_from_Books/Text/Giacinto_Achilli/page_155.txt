Popes, and sent to the most remote countries to preach, together with the Gospel, the primacy, the sovereignty, the infallibility of Rome; and with injunctions to the Most Holy Bishop of Rome, under pain of anathema, that if they did not severely punish, after due inquisition, those who, by disputing the necessary discernment, dared to lessen the honour of the Holy See, they should be deprived of their dignities.

History, Holy Father, teaches us this. However, we read, with equal grief and astonishment, that these orders, however severe, although spread and related by the nations with the greatest veneration, even such as were laden by Rome with privileges, exemptions, and Papal riches, for the sake, even more than the princes, of the Popes, conversed with them familiarly, sat at their side, and could obtain from the Holy Spirit a choice for an happy change, silver and gold as Agabus did other favours; yet how Christ, while the Virgin was spent with thirst, restrained his omnipotence and reached the Popes, even their courts, through their Rome, the most beautiful city in the world.

But times changed, that is to say, many well-informed persons amongst the faithful, perceived the imposture of these sellers of Christ; and first with words, afterwards by acts, revolted against the disorder which not only blinded them with error, but soiled and oppressed them.

And although this correction, falsely given the air of heresy and schism, was enough to lessen the obedience to the Papal precepts, and took from the Popes the greater part of their nations, who, enlightened and made wise by the faith of their ancestors, took their arms, and one might say, the mountain, that by the use of their artillery they might destroy the work of Luther and all Germany; then we see Rome comforted in that, although she had lost so many provinces, she had not lost the obedience of the Most Christian King, of the Catholic King, and of the other princes, who, as they had done for three centuries, favoured her with their arms and their treasures.

Holy Father, how has this hope for three centuries failed you! Nay, you yourself have had the grief of losing several

that he was known by and respected by several of the memorialists, and by others who feel the deepest interest in his personal welfare. The Memorial solicited Lord Palmerston's interference through the Consular Agent at Rome.

The steps taken by the French Government led to the attempt at justification on the part of the Inquisition, described in the following letter. The statement of my informant (whose name is not essential to the narrative), was confirmed by M. de Tocqueville, at the interview with that Minister, on the 29th July, 52. Dr. Achilli had been arrested, mentioned in page 9, and now, for the first time, his friends learned,—an accusation which turned out to be neither more nor less than a barefaced fabrica- tion :—

Paris, Sept. 17, 1847.

My Dear Sir,

I am very sorry to have to communicate information which must distress you, whether it ultimately prove to be correct or otherwise.

M. de Tocqueville has received a despatch from Rome, an extract from which he has kindly allowed me to see. It states, in substance :—

1. That M. Achilli, previously to taking orders, was attached to a young lady whose friends rejected his suit.

2. That the lady retired to a convent of Dominicans at Viterbo.

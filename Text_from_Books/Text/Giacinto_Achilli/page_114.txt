taken place; so many parties had been called out, almost empty; so much so, that his post had been. Our friends gratefully recognised the hand of Providence in helping them to find the Sergeant on duty, on July 29. By his statements their case was virtually proved, even if they could learn no more about the identical Corporal.

At one time, the non-commissioned officers, who took great pains on the subject, thought they had found the Corporal. That night, near the Piazza Borghese, but did not recollect that it was in a palace where the Voltigeurs of the 25th were quartered, M. Meyrueis requested him to accompany him to Adju- tant Gandin, of the 25th; but they did not recognise each other. He then took him to the Palazzo Borghese, but the Corporal at once said that he was sure that he had arrested no one there. On their way back, he stopped at a corner of the Piazza Borghese, and, pointing to a tall house down a street, said that that was the house, at the third floor, &c., &c., where he had arrested the man. So that it was clear that he was not the Corporal who had arrested Achilli. M. Meyrueis saw other Corporals who had been on duty the same night; but they had arrested so many people, and it was now so many months ago, that they could not recollect particulars.

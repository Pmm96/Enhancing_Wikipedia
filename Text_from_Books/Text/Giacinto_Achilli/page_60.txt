IMPRISONMENT, &c. OF DR. ACHILLI.

I protest against the illegality of my detention, because it is under a tribunal composed of Cardinals and of the Pope, who are at present not at Rome. I protest against the irregularity of the proceedings, because two months of strict imprisonment have elapsed without my ever having been examined; nor has the true reason of my incarceration been declared. And I wish this protest to stand good with the Government of her Britannic Majesty, whose subject I declare myself to be, so that they should insist upon my liberation. And I protest against the French Republic, by whom I have been arrested and consigned to the Inquisitorial tribunal, because this arrest may have injured the rights of every one in matters of conscience and of religion. And since it is the police of the French Government which has put me in prison, since I have nothing to do with the Pontifical Government, since I have nothing to be judged by a French tribunal, since I am no longer domiciled in the Roman Church, — 1st, because I am a foreigner; 2nd, because I am no longer a priest of the Roman Church; 3rd, because, during the time of my sojourn here, no one accuses me of having transgressed the Roman laws.

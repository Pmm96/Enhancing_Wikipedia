of the Inquisition has, in answer to the French Government, attributed criminal acts to Dr. Achilli, apart from his religious faith. Believing these accusations to be manifestly and on the surface false, they ask for his liberation, as having been made a prisoner under French authority. They understand he is to be transferred from the Castle of St. Angelo to the prisons of the Inquisition immediately after the close of the door, to be tried by that tribunal; after which, on his withdrawal by the French troops from Rome, his doom may be regarded as certain.

They therefore implore the French Government not to leave him helpless in the hands of his ecclesiastical adversaries, who would believe his death (or his perpetual imprisonment, if not death itself) to be warranted for that exercise of conscience which is the recognised right of every Frenchman.

They feel assured that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with every other generous mind in this country, will shrink from leaving any man, arrested under French authority, in the power of a tribunal, the very name of which is odious to the whole Christendom.

The undersigned present to M. de Tocqueville the assurance of their high respect, and beg to subscribe themselves

His obedient, humble Servants,
